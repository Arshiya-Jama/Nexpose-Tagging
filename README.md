# Nexpose Tagging

This was created for integrating the compliance and governance teams policies into the existing Vulnerability Mangement workflow. Compliance team had decided on a criticality rating for the assets in the environment and the patching and vulnerabilities on these assets was to be prioritized as per this rating. 

As the list of the assets to be tagged was over a 1000, manually applying them was cumbersome. In this program, we import a CSV generated by the compliance team which will match the assets with the relavant tag and these get prioritized in the reports exported by the VM tool. 

We use Rapid7 APIs which can be found from: https://help.rapid7.com/insightvm/en-us/api/index.html

Prerequisites:
1. Active Nexpose/InsightVM console
2. Nexpose security console information such as IP address and login credentials
3. CSV file with IP addresses and tag (sample attached) 
4. Python 3+
5. Postman (optional - will help with testing the API)
